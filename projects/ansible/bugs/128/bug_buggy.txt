Docs for win_firewall_rule (protocol is mandatory if localport is specified)
##### SUMMARY
win_firewall_rule docs do not specify that protocol is mandatory when specifying a port. This is not obvious, in my case i wanted a rule to allow both TCP and UDP.

MSFT docs for New-NetFirewallRule specifies:
"If the Protocol parameter value is TCP or UDP, then the acceptable values for this parameter are- etc.." something similar in the ansible docs would make sense

https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/31576 makes clear a change to docs would be helpful.
