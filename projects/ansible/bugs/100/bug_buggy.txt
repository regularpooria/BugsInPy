##### SUMMARY
<!--- Describe the new feature/improvement briefly below -->
Each VM instance in an Azure VM Scale Set (VMSS) has a computer name (hostname) which is distinct from the instance name. Currently azure_rm_virtualmachinescalesetinstance_facts returns the instance name but not the computer name. It would be extremely helpful if the module can return the computer name as well.

##### ISSUE TYPE
- Feature Idea

##### COMPONENT NAME
<!--- Write the short name of the module, plugin, task or feature below, use your best guess if unsure -->
azure_rm_virtualmachinescalesetinstance_facts

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
<!--- Describe how the feature would be used, why it is needed and what it would solve -->
We are using this module in [Muchos](https://github.com/apache/fluo-muchos). If azure_rm_virtualmachinescalesetinstance_facts returned the computer name as well, it would help us populate etc/hosts and other related files much more seamlessly.
