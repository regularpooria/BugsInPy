Clarify that password parameter in user module docs is hashed
### Summary

From a mastodon user - the password parameter could make it clearer that is a password hash.

Ideally, the key would be called password_hash instead of password. 

If that is not possible, it would be nice to add a disclaimer that this doesn't encrypt the password for you. You could also extend the examples of the user module to show how to set the user password by calculating the hash with the jinja2 filter.
