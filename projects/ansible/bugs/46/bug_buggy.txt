##### SUMMARY
<!--- Explain the problem briefly below, add suggestions to wording or structure -->

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/password_lookup.html :

> Define comma separated list of names that compose a custom character set in the generated passwords.
> They can be either parts of Python's string module attributes (ascii_letters,digits, etc) or are used literally ( :, -).

I suggest to list all possible names or at least add a link to python string module documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html

Now you have to search for the relevant python documentation yourself.
