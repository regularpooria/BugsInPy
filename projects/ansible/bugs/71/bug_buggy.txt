[get_url] argument sha256sum declared deprecated without target version
### SUMMARY
```
  sha256sum:
    description:
      - If a SHA-256 checksum is passed to this parameter, the digest of the
        destination file will be calculated after it is downloaded to ensure
        its integrity and verify that the transfer completed successfully.
        This option is deprecated. Use C(checksum) instead.
```

There is no `module.deprecate` either for `sha256sum`.

the argument has been declared deprecated in commit b3b11fbce26 (2017)
