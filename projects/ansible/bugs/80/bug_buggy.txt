##### SUMMARY
<!--- Explain the problem briefly below -->
Ansible currently contains two modules for managing AWS EC2 instances: [`ec2`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ec2_module.html) and [`ec2_instance`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ec2_instance_module.html).

There is considerable overlap between the modules, but it's unclear what the differences are and why there are two modules in the first place.
