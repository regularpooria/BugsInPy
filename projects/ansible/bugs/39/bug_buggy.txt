### Issue Type

Bug Report

### Component Name

test?

### Ansible Version

```console
2.9.27
```


### Configuration

```console
N/A
```


### OS / Environment

Fedora Linux 36, Python 3.10.1, pytest 7.0.0rc1

### Steps to Reproduce

In Fedora, we build the packages in this copr: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/churchyard/pytest-7/

Unfortunately, I don't know ansible much and I don't know how you run the tests, but should be reproducible if you install a pre-release pytest to the environment.

### Expected Results

The tests should pass, as they do with pytest 6.2.5.

### Actual Results

- Actual results for ansible: [ansible-builder-live.log.gz](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/files/7734616/ansible-builder-live.log.gz)
- Actual results for ansible-core: [ansible-core-builder-live.log.gz](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/files/7734617/ansible-core-builder-live.log.gz)
