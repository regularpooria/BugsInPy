apt_repository module requires gpg to be installed target, but docs don't mention
### Summary

The `apt_repository` will fail with a somewhat confusing error if gnugp, and dirmngr manager are not installed.  Neither of these packages are Required/Essential/Important, and may not be already installed in minimal systems that you might want to run `apt_repository` on.

The fix might be to just include `gnupg` in the requirements section of the docs.
