TOML inventory examples in documentation are confusing
##### SUMMARY

When browsing the [toml inventory source](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory/toml.html) documentation, I found the examples included on that page to be confusing.

It looks like there should be three separate example TOML files, but instead, there's one code listing, with three YAML parameters, like:

```yaml
example1: |
    toml here...

example2: |
    toml here...

example3: |
    toml here...
```

This makes it confusing as to how I'm supposed to format my toml-based inventory, because it looks like I can define multiple TOML inventories in one YAML file as arbitrary strings, or something along those lines.
