get_url documentation formats "not" incorrectly
### Summary

The `get_url` module documentation has extraneous formatting in the "not" word in:
```
NTLM authentication is C(not) supported even if the GSSAPI mech for NTLM has been installed.
```
As it is a part of a sentence, I suspect the "not" here should not have any specific formatting.
