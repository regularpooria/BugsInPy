systemd module result is different than calling systemctl to stop and disable
### Summary

when i use ansible systemd module, but the result is different between using systemd module and not using systemd module. 


```
 - name: using systemd module
    systemd:
      name: my.service
      state: stopped
      enabled: no
```

```
- name: using just command stop
  command: systemctl stop my.service

- name: using just command disable
  command: systemctl disable my.service
```
In Detail, my.service's killMode is process (KillMode=process), so if i stop my.service, another process in my.service cgroup  are not killed.  but when i use systemd module to stop and disable,  all process in my.service cgroup are killed
