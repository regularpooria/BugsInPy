  configured module search path = ['/home/navarihtak/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /home/navarihtak/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible

  python version = 3.8.10 (default, Nov 14 2022, 12:59:47) [GCC 9.4.0]

### Configuration

```console
# if using a version older than ansible-core 2.12 you should omit the '-t all'
$ ansible-config dump --only-changed -t all
$ ansible-config dump --only-changed
DEFAULT_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE(env: ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE) = /home/navarihtak/.ansible/.vault_pass
HOST_KEY_CHECKING(env: ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING) = False
$
```

### Steps to Reproduce

```yaml
      - name: Add user for Darwin
        user:
          name: "{{ username }}"
          comment: "{{ username }}"
          shell: "/bin/bash"
          group: "{{ user_group }}"
          password: "{{ user_pass }}"
          update_password: always
          state: present
        when: ansible_os_family == 'Darwin'
        become: yes
