"file" docs reference non-existent param in other modules
##### SUMMARY
See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/file_module.html, where for the parameter "state" it says:
"see the touch value or the ansible.builtin.copy or ansible.builtin.template module"

Neither
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-copy-module
nor
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/template_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-template-module
have anything about "touch".

The "file" page also says "Even with other options (i.e mode), the file will be modified but will NOT be created if it does not exist", but a sentence later it describes "touch" value for this same parameter.

Perhaps the "see..." reference should be removed, and the note reworded like this?

"Even with other options (i.e mode), the file will be modified but will NOT be created if it does not exist. Use state touch to have the file created."
