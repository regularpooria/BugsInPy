```

### Expected Results

```
$ ansible-playbook package.yml

PLAY [Playbook to test package_facts module locally on Suse based systems.] *******

TASK [Gathering Facts] *****************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Gather package facts on Suse based systems] ************************************
ok: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP *****************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
ACTUAL RESULTS
$ ansible-playbook package.yml

PLAY [Playbook to test package_facts module locally on Suse based system.] *******

TASK [Gathering Facts] *****************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Gather package facts on Suse based systems] ************************************
[WARNING]: Found "rpm" but Failed to import the required Python library (rpm) on localhost's Python /usr/bin/python3.6. Please read the module
documentation and install it in the appropriate location. If the required library is installed, but Ansible is using the wrong Python interpreter,
please consult the documentation on ansible_python_interpreter

fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Could not detect a supported package manager from the following list: ['portage', 'rpm', 'apk', 'pkg', 'pacman', 'apt'], or the required Python library is not installed. Check warnings for details."}
```

Temporary workaround:
To install python-rpm package on any Suse based systems where package_facts module is going to be used for.
