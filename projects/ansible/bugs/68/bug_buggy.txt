##### SUMMARY
<!--- Explain the problem briefly below -->
-When execute "IndicatorLed*" command on blade servers, it will show error message  "Key IndicatorLED not found". That is because blade servers have two chassis. /redfish/v1/chassis/1 is for the node itself , and it has the key IndicatorLED. /redfish/v1/chassis/2 is for the chassis the node located in and it doesn't have key IndicatorLED. Ansible will execute set IndicatorLed command on every chassis it found but only return the results of the last chassis, which cause this fail.

<!--- Describe exactly how to reproduce the problem, using a minimal test-case -->

<!--- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->
```yaml
 /opt/python/python27/bin/ansible localhost -m redfish_command -a "category=Chassis command= IndicatorLedOn  baseuri=10.245.23.209  username=USERID password= " 
```
The remote server is Lenovo blade server SN550, and it located in chassis. Execute IndicatorLedOn  command and it failed, which is because the server has two chassis members. chassis/1 is for the node and chassis/2 is for the chassis. The chassis/2 don't have the property IndicatorLed but Ansible will execute IndicatorLedOn  command on all memebers it found,
