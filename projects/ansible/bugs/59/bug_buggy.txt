##### SUMMARY
Please update the documentation for the Setup module to include a note to check the Delegated Facts (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.html#delegated-facts) documentation. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to set just the required facts for a group of servers remote servers and it was simple once I found the right document.
Or better yet, include the example from the Delegated Facts in the Examples section of the Setup module.
