'groups' feature of user builtin doesn't mention deleting groups
### Summary

I was surprised to after using Ansible to add some users to a group, that they had been removed from all other groups (crucially, including one used to grant them `sudo` rights!).

### Additional Information

I re-read the docs for the `user` built-in and it only mentions that the user will be *added* to groups mentioned in the groups list. The docs currently fail to mention that they will be removed from all groups *not* in the groups array.

I presume this behavior is as intended, but the docs should clarify that the user's non-primary groups will be set to exactly those in the list, any other pre-existing group memberships will be removed.

Here's a sample playbook that illustrated the behavior:

```yaml
---
- hosts: fave-server
  become: true
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: "add users to some group"
      loop:
        - sue
        - john
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        groups:
          - some
```

Try having the users already exist with other group memberships and they will be removed and replace with only a `some` group membership. (I tested with Ansible 2.11.5).
