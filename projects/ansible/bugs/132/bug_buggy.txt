Windows service installed with win_nssm fails to start with win_service

##### SUMMARY
Starting a Windows service with the `win_service` module and that was installed with the `win_nssm` module fails when a username and password are required. If I enter the password manually into the nssm GUI editor and re-run the playbook then the service successfully starts.

I used the `win_nssm` module to install and `win_service` module to start a Windows service that takes a username and password. [As recommended in the win_nssm documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/win_nssm_module.html#examples), I use the `win_nssm` module only to install the service. The username and password are passed to the `win_service` module as the `user` and `password` parameters when starting the service.

##### COMPONENT NAME
- win_nssm
- win_service

##### ANSIBLE VERSION
<!--- Paste verbatim output from "ansible --version" between quotes -->
```
ansible 2.8.2
  config file = /home/kdouglas/src/pt/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/home/kdouglas/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /home/kdouglas/venvs/ansible/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /home/kdouglas/venvs/ansible/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.6.8 (default, Jan 14 2019, 11:02:34) [GCC 8.0.1 20180414 (experimental) [trunk revision 259383]]

##### CONFIGURATION
<!--- Paste verbatim output from "ansible-config dump --only-changed" between quotes -->
```
DEFAULT_HOST_LIST(/home/kdouglas/src/pt/ansible/ansible.cfg) = ['/home/kdouglas/src/pt/ansible/hosts']
```

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Host machine:
```
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
Release:        18.04
Codename:       bionic
```

Remote machine:
```
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit
Python: 3.6.8
```

Configuration for WinRM:
```
ansible_connection: winrm
ansible_user: pt
ansible_password: "{{ lookup('aws_ssm', 'xxxxxx') }}"
ansible_winrm_transport: credssp
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
```


##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
The two relevant tasks in the playbook look like the following and are based on the examples for the `win_nssm` documentation.

```yaml
- name: Install the pt executor service
  win_nssm:
    name: "{{ pt_service_name }}"
    application: '{{ pt_config_dir }}\{{ venv_name }}\Scripts\executor.exe'
    app_parameters_free_form: "-c {{ node_name }} {{ pt_server }}"

- name: Start the pt executor service
  win_service:
    name: "{{ pt_service_name }}"
    start_mode: auto
    state: started
    username: "{{ executor_login }}"
    password: "{{ pt_jc_password }}"
```

I run these tasks with the command `ansible-playbook -i hosts pt.yml`. Unfortunately, I get the following error:

```
fatal: [WIN-1]: FAILED! => {"can_pause_and_continue": false, "changed": false, "depended_by": [], "dependencies": [], "description": "", "desktop_interact": false, "display_name": "pt", "exists": true, "msg": "Service 'pt (pt)' cannot be started due to the following error: Cannot start service pt on computer '.'.", "name": "pt", "path": "C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\NSSM\\tools\\nssm.exe", "start_mode": "auto", "state": "stopped", "username": ".\\pt"}
```

Repeatedly running the playbook still results in the error. However, the playbook will work if I manually run `nssm edit pt` in a PowerShell terminal on the machine and enter the password into the NSSM GUI service editor window that appears.

I observe this behavior across multiple Windows 10 Pro machines and when using both Ansible 2.8.1 and Ansible 2.8.2. I also tested the development version of Ansible (commit 262c9ffdb6c995d67a8dfd3707ec8bb09a4fd77d) and see the same behavior.

In addition, I tried using the deprecated `user` and `password` parameters of the `win_nssm` module but this failed as well.

##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I expect that the playbook successfully starts the pt executor service.
