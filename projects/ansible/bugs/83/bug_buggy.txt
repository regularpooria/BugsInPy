##### SUMMARY
@LKaemmerling As discussed in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59133#issuecomment-515133800, you said there would be network filtering in the hcloud dynamic inventory plugin (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory/hcloud.html) in Ansible 2.9. But this functionality still doesn't appear. Could it be added? There are many cases where you only want to run ansible commands against servers in some networks only.
