Please document `argument_spec`
### Summary

The [`validate_argument_spec` module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/validate_argument_spec_module.html) accepts the `argument_spec` argument.

This is all the page states:
> argument_spec : A dictionary like AnsibleModule argument_spec

But I can't find the definition of `argument_spec` anywhere.

It would be appreciated if it were documented. Thank you.
