##### SUMMARY

Templates do not appear to be evaluated recursively anymore (see #4638).  I don't know when it changed.  I am using Ansible -devel or 2.8.  If it helps, here is the reproducer from issue #4638:

> [playbook.yml]
> 
> ```
> ---
> - name: "test raw template output"
>   hosts: localhost
> 
>   vars:
>     myvar: "foo"
> 
>   tasks:
>     - local_action: template src="mytemplate.j2" dest="/tmp/myoutput.txt"
> 
> ```
>
> [mytemplate.j2]
>
> ```
> Test: Preserve curly braces, and NOT perform variable substitution:
> 
> First Attempt:
> {% raw %}
>   - { include: "{{ myvar }}" }
> {% endraw %}
> ```
>
> [/tmp/myoutput.txt]
>
> ```
> Test: Preserve curly braces, and NOT perform variable substitution:
> 
> 
> First Attempt:
> 
>   - { include: "foo" }
> ```
> 
> NOTE: template output performs variable substitution even inside the {% raw %} block.

and here is the output *I* got:

```
Test: Preserve curly braces, and NOT perform variable substitution:

First Attempt:

  - { include: "{{ myvar }}" }
```

At least, I really hope this is a documentation bug. I think the old behaviour was a bad idea.  I would not like Ansible to go back to it.

##### COMPONENT NAME

template

##### ANSIBLE VERSION
<!--- Paste verbatim output from "ansible --version" between quotes -->
```
ansible 2.9.0.dev0
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/home/alan-sysop/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /home/alan-sysop/src/ansible/lib/ansible
  executable location = /home/alan-sysop/src/ansible/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.16 (default, Apr 30 2019, 15:54:43) [GCC 9.0.1 20190312 (Red Hat 9.0.1-0.10)]
```

##### CONFIGURATION
<!--- Paste verbatim output from "ansible-config dump --only-changed" between quotes -->

`ansible-config dump --only-changed` shows no output at all.

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
<!--- Provide all relevant information below, e.g. OS version, browser, etc. -->

Fedora Workstation 30

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I'm hoping this is all ancient history now. If so, we can simply remove the sentence in question:

> * Using raw/endraw in Jinja2 will not work as you expect because templates in Ansible are recursively evaluated.
