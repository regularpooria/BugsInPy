azure_rm_virtualmachine does not preserve availability zone info with generalized option
##### SUMMARY
When you try to generalize a vm with availability zones defined in it, zone info is not preserved and must be passed on.

##### ISSUE TYPE
- Bug Report

##### COMPONENT NAME
azure_rm_virtualmachine

##### ANSIBLE VERSION
<!--- Paste verbatim output from "ansible --version" between quotes -->
```paste below
ansible 2.9.0
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [ u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.12 (default, Oct  8 2019, 14:14:10) [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]
```

##### CONFIGURATION
<!--- Paste verbatim output from "ansible-config dump --only-changed" between quotes -->
```paste below

```

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
<!--- Provide all relevant information below, e.g. target OS versions, network device firmware, etc. -->


##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
<!--- Describe exactly how to reproduce the problem, using a minimal test-case -->
When you try to generalize a vm with availability zones defined in it, zone info is not preserved and must be passed on.

 Furthermore zone information itâ€™s not returned by azure_rm_virtualmachine_info so it has to be gathered with azure_rm_resource_info in order to be able to generalize the vm

<!--- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->
```yaml
- name: Generalize VM
  azure_rm_virtualmachine:
    resource_group: "{{ resourcegroup }}"
    name: "{{ vm }}"
    os_type: "{{ os_type | default(omit) }}"
    generalized: yes
    state: present 

```

<!--- HINT: You can paste gist.github.com links for larger files -->

##### EXPECTED RESULTS
<!--- Describe what you expected to happen when running the steps above -->
Generalized VM

##### ACTUAL RESULTS
<!--- Describe what actually happened. If possible run with extra verbosity (-vvvv) -->
<!--- Paste verbatim command output between quotes -->
```paste below
    "msg": "You can't change the Availability Zone of a virtual machine (have: [<zone>], want: None)"

```
##### WORKAROUND
In order to be able to generalize the VM the following code should be used.

```yaml
- name: Get VM Availability Zone
  azure_rm_resource_info:
    resource_group: "{{ resourcegroup }}"
    resource_name: "{{ vm }}"
    resource_type: VirtualMachines 
    provider: Compute
  register: result

- name: Generalize VM
  azure_rm_virtualmachine:
    resource_group: "{{ resourcegroup }}"
    name: "{{ vm }}"
    os_type: "{{ os_type | default(omit) }}"
    generalized: yes
    state: present
    zones: "{{ result.response[0].zones }}"
```
