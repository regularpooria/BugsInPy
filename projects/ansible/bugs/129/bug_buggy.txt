##### SUMMARY
<!--- Explain the problem briefly below -->
Since commit df581eb ovirt_vm is unable to find a template shared among multiple clusters in the same datacenter. Moreover, the document says that `cluster` parameter is a parameter used to define where VMs will be created. Then it should not be used to filter a template search which is not related to VM storage.
