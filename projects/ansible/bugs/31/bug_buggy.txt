Cannot show uri test docs
### Summary

Running `ansible-doc -t test uri` produces
```
ERROR! test ansible.builtin.uri missing documentation (or could not parse documentation): No documentation availalbe for ansible.builtin.uri (/path/to/ansible/lib/ansible/plugins/test/uri.py)
```
It tries to look at `uri.py` instead of `uri.yml` in the same directory.

Listing the tests shows that filter correctly, `--metadata-dump` does not.

This happens both with #78700 and without #78700. #77737 also demonstrates this.
