##### SUMMARY
<!--- Explain the problem briefly below, add suggestions to wording or structure -->
nmcli docs state, for the conn_name option: when not provided a default name is generated: `<type>[-<ifname>][-<num>]`

<!--- HINT: Did you know the documentation has an "Edit on GitHub" link on every page ? -->
