"assemble" docs talk about directories
##### SUMMARY
See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/assemble_module.html .
Many parameters mention directory (for example, "The attributes the resulting file or directory should have.").

This module does not seem to create directories, thus that is rather confusing.

Might not be that simple to fix, as it seems to be a result of:
```
extends_documentation_fragment:
...
- files
```
