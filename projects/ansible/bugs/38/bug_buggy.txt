In 2.12 top-level include stops working, but removal is scheduled for 2.16
### Summary

I have a top-level include like so:

```
- include: foo.yml
```

This worked fine in 2.11, but after updating to 2.12.1, I get:

~~~
ERROR! 'include' is not a valid attribute for a Play
~~~

I know `include` is deprecated and going away, but per the doc this shouldn't happen until 2.16.

### Steps to Reproduce

<!--- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->
```yaml (paste below)
- include: foo.yml
```


### Expected Results

No error, perhaps a deprecation warning depending on your deprecation warnings setting.

### Actual Results

```console
ansible-playbook bar.yml 
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'
ERROR! 'include' is not a valid attribute for a Play

The error appears to be in '.../bar.yml': line 1, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


- include: foo.yml
  ^ here
```
