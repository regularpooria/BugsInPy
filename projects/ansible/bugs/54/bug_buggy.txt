win_dns_record: Add documentation for multi-valued entries
##### SUMMARY
#67628 exposed an area in which `win_dns_record` could be improved, as far as _documenting_ how to add multiple values to a given `A` (or other) record type.

Although the `value` attribute is clearly documented as taking a _list_, **none of the examples actually show that** --- leading to the mistaken impression in the case of #67628 that there was no existing way to do that. A few quick examples would go a long way.

##### ISSUE TYPE
- Bug Report

##### COMPONENT NAME
`win_dns_record`

##### ANSIBLE VERSION
Affects all versions that have this module (ie 2.8 and up)

##### CONFIGURATION
n/a

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Windows 2012+ targets only

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
n/a

##### Musings

Should give examples for both `A` and `MX` records, since those are (probably) the most common multi-valued record types.
